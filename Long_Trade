    <h1>Long Term Investments</h1> 
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">There are many kinds of trading investments for long term such as bonds and dividend holding - reinvestment and so on. </p>
    
    <h2> Bonds</h2>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text"> Bonds can be a complex trading mechanism, it requires you to guess intrest rates and potential large market changes.</p>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">First you must know what a bond is. It is like a loan that a companie (or goverment) issues to raise money when they are unable to secure funds from a bank. You buy the bond and then they pay you a predetermined (when you buy the bond) intrest rate. All that is required of you is to collect (the usally semianualy) intrest fees and when it matures (also predetermined and can take up to 30 years to fully mature!) you collect the price of the bond.</p>
    <h3>Understanding bond price movment</h3>
    
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">To understand the movment you must understand that seemingly small percentage of intrest movments can be huge to large positions. Knowing this when intrest prices raise to say 6% and you have a bond for 5% intrest you bond becomes less desirerable compared to the higher intrest bond and the price of your bond falls. If intrest rates fall then your "high intrest" bond will become more desirable.</p>
   
    <h2>Divedend stocks</h2>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">Dividend stocks are one of the best long term stock investment tools, but first you need to understand a dividend. 
    <br> <br> A dividend is like an intrest payment, except that it is a fraction of the companies earnings - like a reward for owning thier stock. They are usally paid quarterly. 
      
    <h3> Dividend reinvestment and it's rewards</h3>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text"> One of the key componetns of dividends is reinvesting them. For example if you bought 1000 dollars of KO (coca cola) stock when it was first offered and reinvested all it's dividend's into more KO stock you would have around 11 million dollars of KO stock that would keep growing. (note you would probaly be dead to eperince your 11 million dollar wealth beacuse it would take around 103 years to grow to 11 million dollars). Dividend stock's are not perfect. The companie could go broke or the stock price and dividend payout  could fall causing you to lose money.</p>
