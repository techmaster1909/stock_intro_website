    <h1>Short Term Investments</h1>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">There are many stratagies for short term or day trading. Its when hold a position for a short amount of time compared to holding a stock for years or months.It can be a high risk reward gamble.</p>
    
    <h2>Momentum Trading </h2>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">One stratagy (and a somewhat succseful one) is to buy a stock after it has gaped. Wait 10 - 15 minutes to see if it dips below its opening price in that time leave it alone if it dosn't then buy it. Watch throughout the day and if it ever trades below it's opening price sell it, but if not you should be able to pocket a somewhat calculated and easy gain. The reason this happens is that something has happened to the companie and an institution want to buy shares in it sometimes millions and one cannot simply buy that many shares at the click of a button so as the compaine continualy buys shares it drives the price of the stock up.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Overnight sucsess</h2>
    <p class="Switch_Text" id="All_Text">Another side to the trading stratige above is to find a companie that has an upcoming earnings report (this can be found on many stock screeners) that you think will beat the earnings expectation and when this happens the stock will gap upwards towards its true value. Its that simple, except when you find you companie had a lower then expected earnings report and your out 20%.</p>
